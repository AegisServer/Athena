# Athena
Aegis' custom java plugin

# Building
We use Maven to manage our dependeincies and build instructions. Clone the project, and then run `mvn clean package` in the project's root. 
The jar will be inside of the `target` directory.

The very first time you boot up the plugin on your server, it will error and not enable. You need to go to the plugin's `config.yml` and change the url to your MongoDB url.
